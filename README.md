Digital Clock/Alarm System

This is the Digital Clock/Alarm System which is implemented using Verilog. This project was created using the Vivado software interface and implemented on the BASYS-3 FPGA board. This readme file will be a short summary of the project.

For our project, we implemented a digital alarm clock over multiple phases each having its own sequence of events. We started out by dividing our project into several milestones. For our first milestone, we first designed our digital alarm clock visually utilizing various block diagrams such as the ASM chart, the Data Path, and the Control Unit for our whole system. Afterwards, we implemented our digital clock circuit using the powerful Logisim software interface. Our work throughout using Logisim felt seamless due to the softwareâ€™s powerful tools and organization that help in designing every detail of the digital circuit, making circuit creation easier and quicker. After creating our general outline of how our project should look, we had to put our work in action by coding our actual digital alarm clock. Our main software interface for coding that we used was Vivado software, where we coded in Verilog programming language and programmed it onto our FPGA Basys-3 board.
